  Data Storing

## Description
For this occasion, the data is stored in PostgreSQL with the help of Python using the psycopg2 library. The library connects databases to PostgreSQL with Python programs that have been created so that they can query through the program. PostgreSQL as a DBMS offers things that are not found in other DBMS. This DBMS can use an alternate string delimiter and case-insensitive string comparisons. This is what causes PostgreSQL to be superior in terms of features compared to MySQL, although it is rated a little slower.
